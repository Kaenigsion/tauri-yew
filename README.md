# tauri-yew app
This is an app with pure rust (3 lines js :/ ). Why am I doing this? Mostly because I enjoy programming with rust and I really like web development so why not combining those?

## Installation
- install [things needed for tauri](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)
- install [things needed for yew](https://yew.rs/docs/getting-started/introduction)
- run `cargo tauri dev`
