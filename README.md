# tauri-yew app
This is an app with pure rust (3 lines js :/ ). Why am I doing this? Mostly because I enjoy programming with rust and to try new things out.

## Installation
- install (things needed for tauri)[https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites]
- install (things needed for yew)[https://yew.rs/docs/getting-started/introduction]
- run `cargo tauri dev`
